## Starting
    mysql         # Same username, no password
    mysql -p      # Password protected
    mysql -u user
    mysql -h hostname

## Create user
```
CREATE USER me
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'me'@'%';
ALTER USER 'me'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'newPass';
```

## Connect to databaes
    SHOW DATABASES;
    SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'ok%';
    USE mysql;

## See database tables
    SHOW TABLES;
    SHOW TABLES LIKE 'ok%';
    SELECT * FROM important_stuffs;

## Extend tables
    ALTER TABLE important_stuffs ADD description VARCHAR(100);
    ALTER TABLE important_stuffs ADD description VARCHAR(100) AFTER severity;
    ALTER TABLE important_stuffs ADD description VARCHAR(100) FIRST;

## Delete from tables
    SELECT * FROM important_stuffs WHERE severity="low";
    DELETE FROM important_stuffs WHERE severity="low";

## Insert into tables
    INSERT INTO important_stuffs VALUES("Wow, so important", "high");
    INSERT INTO important_stuffs SET description="Wow, so important", severity="high";

## Show access rights
    SHOW GRANTS;

## Change all email addresses to my  (when mailserver is activated)
    UPDATE users SET email= CONCAT('me+', id, '@iix.se');

## General log
    show variables like 'general_log%';
    SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
    SET GLOBAL general_log = 'OFF';

## Run query without cache
    SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE * from users where name like 'Ol%';

## Indexes
    SHOW INDEX FROM users;

    ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX index_name(firstName);
    CREATE INDEX index_name ON users(firstName);
    
    ALTER TABLE users DROP INDEX users;
    DROP INDEX index_name ON users;

## Explain/describe
    EXPLAIN users;
    DESCRIBE users;
    DESC users;

    DESC SELECT * FROM users;

## Profiling
    SET SESSION profiling = 1;
    SHOW PROFILES;
    SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY 3;
    SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Last_Query_Cost';

## How to index/optimize
    # ** Optimize OR **
    Example: SELECT * FROM users where customerNumber='qwe' OR birthDate='2020-01-01';
    You need an index for each OR, which will create a merge index on modern innoDB. If you are missing an index for one OR you will have to do a full table scan. Basically, one condition can ruin the query.
    If you create a joined index on (customerNumber, birthDate) or (birthDate, customerNumber) they will have not effect. To use a joined index you have to do two solo queries and UNION them.

    # ** Optimize AND **
    Example: SELECT * FROM users where customerNumber='qwe' AND birthDate='2020-01-01';
    Every AND index helps, which will create a merge index if possible. If you are missing an index for one AND, you will have to scan the result of the index/merge index. Basically, missing a condition is probably fine.
    If you create a joined index on (customerNumber, birthDate) or birthDate, customerNumber) , they further most likely optimize the query and be used instead. It does not matter the order of customerNumber/birthDate, no matter the order in the select or AND.

    # ** Cover Index **
    Example: SELECT customerNumber, birthDate, memberStartDate FROM users where customerNumber='qwe' AND birthDate='2020-01-01';
    If you want to optimize a query further, you can create a cover index. It is an index which covers all the data in the select statement, making SQL not having to pop by the row to pick the the required data.
    To do so, create an index on (customerNumber, birthDate, memberStartDate). That index will be prioritized over a index on (customerNumber, birthDate) despite memberStartdate not being in the WHERE-part.
