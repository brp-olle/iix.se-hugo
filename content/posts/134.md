Hugo is a framework for building static webpages. It pairs well with creating a git repository and creating a push-webhook which rebuilds the homepage every time you change it.
This post is just documenting how to do just that for an existing hugo repository.

## Create webhook
1. Go to https://github.com/$username/$repository/settings/hooks/new
2. Set up a payload URL
3. Add a secret
4. *Add Webhook*

## Create a webhook webserver/receiver
Probably gonna do something in flask here
